<p>Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.
If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress.
The future rewards those who press on. I don't have time to feel sorry for myself. I don't have time to complain. I'm going to press on.</p>
